MVVM Concept:

In our project we will have 2 view folders, one inside the resource folder for fxml files to separate concerns,
as its not a java file.There is also better compatibility, syntax highlighting by using the resource folder
Then another View file inside the java folder to delegate tasks etc. and to inject fxml annotations.


ViewModel is the mediator it takes actions and tasks from View and uses data and logic from Model if needed
to perform said tasks.

The View imports the ViewModel to delegate tasks or receive data updates.
The ViewModel imports the Model to access business logic and data operations.
The Model remains independent or encapsulated of the ViewModel and the View.

You can tell this by seeing that most Controller classes in View literally only have @FXML annotations which are
injections from the fxml file. As well as the fact that any majority of code in ViewModels such as methods is ONLY
from View or Model packages, it clearly shows how its a mediator.
